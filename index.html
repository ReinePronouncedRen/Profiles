	<p>1. Bio</p>
	<p>Milaxzia belongs to a race known as the Grennyth. Though she refers to herself as a female for the sake of communication with other beings, in reality the Grennyth go through multiple phases in their life cycles in which such classification becomes difficult. They are characterized by a plant-like infancy, growing from seeds into sprouts, until their development reaches a stage where they can remove themselves from the soil and move freely.<br /><br />By adolescence they've taken shape, and what used to be initially appear as petals now wrap themselves around the Grennyth form in a way reminiscent of clothing. These petals hide what is a somewhat amorphous body structure, which will become more robust by adulthood. In this way, their form is highly variable and often dependent on their environment. For Milaxzia, close proximity to humans led to her humanoid shape, though these changes were entirely subconscious. It is at this point that their epidermis begins to form small bumps, which are useless at this stage, but will eventually grow into fully dextrous tentacle-like appendages.<br /><br />The defining characteristic of the Grennyth adulthood is the full formation of their bodies and a solidifying of their structure, though they remain quite soft and elastic even in this state. Hidden beneath their "outfits" are coiled up tentacles that will reveal themselves when needed, but remain tucked away and protected when not in use. It isn't until adulthood that communication becomes completely effective, often sounded garbled and muffled at younger stages. This is due to the same development occurring on their skin also taking place in their mouths. A complicated system of tentacles take the place of what most other creatures have as teeth and tongues. How these tentacles are used to form crisp and clear sounds is not fully understood.<br /><br />In addition to the strange growth cycles of the Grennyth, their bodies produce various secretions in order to maintain healthy hydration, as well as a number of glands that can produce a dangerous toxin that, while non-lethal, can cause brief periods of psychosis and hallucination with no lasting negative effects.
